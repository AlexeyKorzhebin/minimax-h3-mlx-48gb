"""Phase-scoped component residency for a 48 GB machine.

`MiniMaxH3Pipeline.from_pretrained` loads the encoder, the DiT and both VAEs up front and holds all
four for the whole run — 45.9 GB of weights, and ~55 GB once the diffusion phase's own activations
are added, against 48 GB of physical memory. But the components are used in
strict phases: the text encoder is read exactly once (`pipeline.py` line 238), the video VAE
encodes keyframes and then is idle until the final decode, and the DiT only matters in between.

Most of this reimplements nothing. Two seams are enough for residency:

* Every component is replaced by a **proxy** that already knows its config — which is what the
  early lines of `__call__` actually need (``dit.config.patch_size``,
  ``video_vae.config.spatial_compression_ratio``, ``audio_vae.config.latent_channels``) — and loads
  its weights on the first access to anything else.
* The text-encoder proxy owns the unload. ``self.text_encoder.encode(...)`` is the encoder's only
  call site, so the proxy runs it, **materializes the result**, and then drops the weights. The
  `mx.eval` is not optional: MLX is lazy, and a returned graph still referencing the encoder's
  parameters pins all 28.2 GB no matter what is deleted.

`_ensure_cache` is overridden as well, because this build's AdaLN table is precomputed rather than
computable — see :mod:`h3_48gb.adaln`.

`__call__` stays a thin wrapper too, for the same reason :mod:`h3_48gb.checkpoint` gives for its own
seams: wrapping `self.dit` sees everything a per-step hook needs (the full packed rows entering
every forward) without duplicating the denoising loop itself. `preview_every` / `preview_stem`
install :class:`h3_48gb.preview.PreviewInterceptor` the same way `checkpoint_dir` installs
`h3_48gb.checkpoint.StepInterceptor` — nested around it if both are active, so a step the checkpoint
fast-forwards is invisible to the preview too. See :mod:`h3_48gb.preview` for the hook itself and
for why a preview can only ever decode the VAE's minimum chunk, not an arbitrary frame.

        the pixel-mean/std unnormalize, the [0, 1] clip and the *0.5 uint8 round entirely in numpy,
        on the host. Every one of those reassigns `frames` to a brand-new full-size array — on a
        10 s clip at the native canvas that is four float32 copies of the whole video (measured
        +10.8 GB RSS beyond the VAE's own 15.4 GB MLX peak; see
        `docs/FEASIBILITY-chunked-vae.md` and the probe it was measured with). None of that
        arithmetic needs numpy: `mx.clip`, multiply and `.astype(mx.uint8)` do the same thing on
        the still-lazy MLX graph, so the *only* array that ever crosses into numpy is the final
        uint8 frame buffer — a quarter the size of one of the float32 copies upstream made, and
        there is exactly one of it. `test_decode_video_matches_upstream_bytes` pins this against
