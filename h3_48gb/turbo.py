"""Turbo LoRA as a runtime side path over 4-bit weights.

The Turbo LoRA (`larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora`) trains MiniMax-H3 to sample in 4-8 steps instead
of 30. It arrives in two halves, and they must be applied in completely different ways:

* **The AdaLN half** (102 of 518 tensors) lives in the 2688-dim ``silu(t_emb)`` space that this
  build's pruned base folded away. It is baked into the modulation table instead — see
  ``scripts/bake_adaln.py``. That table is bf16, so folding costs nothing at run time.
* **The backbone half** (416 tensors: ``attn.qkv_proj``, ``attn.out_proj``, ``mlp.fc1``,
  ``mlp.fc2``) is what this module applies, and it **must not be merged into the weights**. Those
  weights are 4-bit: the update's rms is 3.37e-05 against a quantization step of 1.19e-02, so it is
  0.3% of one step and requantization would discard 99.7% of the training. It is added at run time
  as ``y = quantized(x) + strength * (x @ A.T) @ B.T`` — about 1.5% more work in the linear layers
  and none at all in attention, which is where the time actually goes.

**The QKV rows have to be permuted.** This fork's ``attn.qkv_proj`` is in the release's per-head
interleave (``[h0:q,k,v][h1:q,k,v]...``), restored by ``convert_sawfwair.py`` from the global slabs
mere.run had rewritten it into. The LoRA is in slabs. Measured rather than assumed: grouping
``lora_B``'s row norms by slab separates q/k/v where grouping by head does not — in block 49 the v
slab is half the magnitude of q and k (0.0051 against 0.0102 and 0.0108), and that structure
vanishes entirely under the per-head grouping (0.0086/0.0087/0.0088). Applying an unpermuted
``lora_B`` raises nothing; it just scrambles which head each correction lands on.
