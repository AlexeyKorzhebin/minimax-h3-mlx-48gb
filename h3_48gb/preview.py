"""Mid-generation preview frames: see the shot before spending the rest of a multi-hour render.

A 1344x768 clip runs 5-15.7 hours end to end (5s / 10s), all of it spent before
``MiniMaxH3Pipeline._decode_video`` produces a single visible pixel. If the prompt missed or the
composition is wrong, that is discovered only at the very end. This module decodes one frame from
the current (partially denoised) latent every few steps instead.

Two constraints shaped the design, both measured rather than assumed:

* **The VAE can't decode less than one chunk.** `VideoVAE.decode` (`upstream/minimax_h3_mlx/
  video_vae.py`) is a causal chunked decoder: its temporal padding assumes frame 0 of whatever it
  is given is the true start of the clip, and it refuses fewer than
  ``2 * chunk_tokens - token_drop`` latent frames outright (its own ``ValueError``). For the
  released config that floor is 7 latent frames -> about 22 pixel frames (~1s at 24 fps) — there is
  no cheaper *correct* VAE decode than that, and it must start at frame 0, not at the step's
  "interesting" moment. `render_preview_frame` decodes exactly that minimal prefix and keeps one
  representative frame from the middle of it.
* **Tiling cost is spatial, not temporal.** `VideoVAE._decode_clip` tiles over height/width
  regardless of how many latent frames it is given (256px tiles, 64px overlap -> 28 tiles at
  1344x768), so decoding the 7-frame floor still walks the full native canvas through the 36-layer
  ViT decoder. Measured on this machine (correctly-shaped random weights — the real checkpoint
  is not downloaded here; compute cost depends on shapes/dtypes, not weight values):
  weights resident 5.2 GB, decode itself 49s wall time, peak allocator usage 8.5 GB. See
  `docs/RESULTS.md` ("Previews") for how that compares to the diffusion loop's own budget, and for
  the same caveat about where those three numbers come from.

That decode happens with the video VAE loaded on demand and unloaded again immediately after,
rather than kept resident for the whole diffusion loop: keeping it resident would add its ~5.2 GB
on top of the DiT's *own* peak activation moment (up to ~42 GB projected at 1344x768/15s), which
is uncomfortably close to the 44 GB GPU limit. A preview's decode instead runs between steps, after
the previous step's activations have already been freed by `mx.eval` — so the concurrent peak is
DiT weights + AdaLN cache + the VAE's own 8.5 GB, comfortably under budget regardless of duration.
The trade-off is repeated load/unload across the run instead of one load; at the default cadence
of every 5 steps that is a handful of extra loads against a run measured in hours.

Every entry point but `emit_preview` raises on failure — that keeps them independently testable.
`emit_preview` is the only one the diffusion loop should call: it never raises, because a broken
preview must never cost the hours of compute already spent on the real generation (requirement 3
of the task this module implements).

`PreviewInterceptor` is how this hooks into the loop at all, and it deliberately does *not*
reimplement `MiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__` the way :mod:`h3_48gb.checkpoint` reasons it would have to
for checkpointing. A preview only needs to *see* the state entering a step, and upstream's loop
already hands the full packed rows to the transformer every step — so wrapping `pipeline.dit`, the
same trick `h3_48gb.checkpoint.StepInterceptor` uses, is enough. `LazyMiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__`
installs it immediately before delegating to `super().__call__()` and restores the original `dit`
in a `finally`, so it composes with checkpointing's own wrapping rather than fighting it: whichever
one is installed first ends up on the outside, and a step the checkpoint fast-forwards never
reaches this wrapper at all (there is nothing new to preview in state that was already on disk).
