"""The windowed video-to-video refine engine -- the GPU half of the face-refine pipeline.

It takes the 448x288 crops `facepaste.crop_window` cut around a tracked face (Task 2), denoises
them in overlapping 56-frame windows on a *partial* sigma schedule, crossfades the windows back
into one continuous clip, and hands the result back for `facepaste.paste_back` to composite onto
the source frames. Nothing here knows about faces, files or ffmpeg: in goes a `(F, H, W, 3)` uint8
stack, out comes a `(F, H, W, 3)` uint8 stack of the same shape.

**None of the v2v mechanics below were invented here.** They are the three experiment rounds
recorded in `docs/FEASIBILITY-face-refine.md`, ported from the scripts that ran them
(`~/Research/TestVideo/face-refine-exp/v2v_face_refine.py`, `.../bake_partial.py`,
`.../round2/overlap/crossfade.py`). Every constant in this module is a measurement, and the
docstrings say which round measured it. Re-deriving any of them from taste would silently undo a
day of GPU time.

**Why a partial schedule and not keyframe conditioning.** Keyframe rows are noised once to
`t = 0.999` and then *held* there for every step -- they anchor a clip, they are never denoised
(see `h3_48gb/pipeline.py`'s module docstring, and § A of the feasibility doc). Face-refine needs
the opposite: the crop's own latent has to live in the *generated* row block and be denoised from
a low starting sigma down to 0. That is `scale_noise(x0, t = 1 - sigma)` into `video_rows`, with
`n_cond_v = 0` -- simpler than i2v, not harder -- against an AdaLN table baked for a grid that
starts at that sigma instead of at 1.0 (`ensure_partial_table`).

**Why sigma is capped at 0.25.** Round 2 ran the same crop at 0.15 / 0.25 / 0.40 on a genuinely
soft face. At 0.25 eyelids, lashes, brows, nostrils and teeth assemble out of mush and the face
stays the same face. At 0.40 the model *invents*: it opened an eye with a full iris where the
source had a squint, and the "engraved" over-sharpened look of round 1 came back. 0.25 is not a
default a caller may raise -- above it the pass stops being a refine and starts being a
generation, so `refine_clip` raises rather than obeying.

**Why windows overlap and crossfade instead of butting together.** A production shot is 3-7
windows. Round 3 put two windows over the same footage (0-55 and 28-83, bit-identical input in
the overlap) and measured what they disagree on: the *weight* and contrast of invented detail,
not its position -- geometry is pinned by the shared source latent, so the windows are
co-registered by construction. A hard cut still ticks (+1.41 sigma on a motion-compensated step
metric); a 12-frame pixel crossfade removes it completely, with no ghosting, because averaging
two versions of one eyebrow gives an eyebrow rather than two. Hence `crossfade >= 12`, an overlap
of 12-16 frames is enough, and the resulting step of 42 costs 35% less GPU than the 28 of the
experiment.

**Why the phases are ordered encode-all / denoise-all / decode-all rather than per window.**
`pipeline._decode_video` releases the transformer before it decodes -- correct for a single long
generation, where the decode is the memory peak, and wrong here, where it would make every window
after the first pay a full DiT load. Rows are tiny (a 56-frame window is ~0.5 MB of latent rows),
so the whole plan's worth fits in memory with room to spare, and running each stage to completion
for every window before moving on costs exactly one text-encoder load, one VAE-encode residency,
one DiT residency and one VAE-decode residency for a clip of any length. The peak is unchanged:
it is the 28.2 GB text encoder (round 1 measured 28.4 GB total), which is released before the
first latent is encoded.

**Ordering discipline around the RNG.** This codebase has a documented history of seeds drawn on
the wrong side of a lazy module build (`h3_48gb/pipeline.py:293-331`: two identical keyframes
encoding 0.83 apart). Both loops below therefore materialize the component they need *before*
seeding -- `video_vae.load()` then `mx.random.seed(KEYFRAME_ENCODE_SEED)`, `dit.load()` then
`mx.random.seed(seed)` -- because building a module draws from MLX's global stream. The denoise
seed is re-set per window on purpose (round 3 ran both windows on one seed): every window then
sees the same noise realization over co-registered content, and a window's output does not depend
on how many windows preceded it in the plan.
