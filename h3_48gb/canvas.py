"""MiniMax-H3 canvas arithmetic without `mlx`.

`resolve_canvas_size` is copied from `upstream/minimax_h3_mlx/packing.py`, which imports `mlx.core`
at module scope and so cannot be imported by the panel (web request path, or a machine with no
MLX). The function is pure arithmetic over four constants; `tests/test_canvas.py` pins this copy
against the upstream one wherever MLX is installed, so a drift is a failing test on the Mac.
