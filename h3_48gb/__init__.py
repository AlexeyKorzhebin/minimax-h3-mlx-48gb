"""Fork-side patches for running MiniMax-H3 on a 48 GB Mac from the mere.run/Sawfwair build.

`upstream/` is never edited, so it can be fast-forwarded; everything here is applied from the
outside. Four changes, in descending order of how badly they fail without it:

1. :mod:`h3_48gb.adaln` — the mere.run transformer omits the AdaLN modulation path entirely
   (106 tensors), having precomputed it into ``adaln_cache.safetensors``. This serves the port's
   ``ModulationCache`` interface from that file, with the ``(step, variant, modality)`` layout
   established from the data and a hard failure on any schedule the table was not baked for.
2. :mod:`h3_48gb.text_encoder` — the port has no quantization path and would load mere.run's 8-bit
   conditioner as packed integers in bf16 slots, silently.
3. :mod:`h3_48gb.pipeline` — components load per phase instead of all at once (45.9 GB of
   weights resident, ~55 GB with activations at 1344x768/5 s; see ``docs/RESULTS.md``).
4. The same module unloads the 28.2 GB text encoder after its single call, materializing its output
   first so the release is real.
5. :mod:`h3_48gb.checkpoint` — a run is resumable. At 586 s per step over 30 steps a crash on the
   last one costs five hours, and fifteen for a ten-second clip; the state that carries a run
   forward is two arrays and fits in a file written between steps.
6. :mod:`h3_48gb.preview` — a run is *watchable*. The same five-hour clip produces no visible pixel
   until the very end; a wrong prompt or composition is otherwise discovered only after paying for
   the whole render. ``preview_every`` decodes one frame from the current latent every N steps and
   writes it next to where the finished clip will land.

Usage::

    from h3_48gb import LazyMiniMaxH3Pipeline

    pipe = LazyMiniMaxH3Pipeline.from_pretrained("~/models/h3-converted")
    result = pipe("a cat", num_inference_steps=31, height=512, width=512,
                  checkpoint_dir="~/video-out/checkpoints",
                  preview_every=5, preview_stem="~/video-out/h3-run")

Re-running the same call resumes where the last one stopped; a call with different parameters is
refused rather than silently continued. ``preview_every=0`` (the default) disables previews.
