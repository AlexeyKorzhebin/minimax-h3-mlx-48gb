"""Crash-safe checkpoints between denoising steps, and resumption from them.

A 5-second clip at 1344x768 costs ~586 s per step over 30 steps; ten seconds costs 15.7 hours. A
crash on step 29 currently throws away every one of them. Nothing about the loop makes that
necessary: the state carried from one step to the next is just two arrays — the video rows and the
audio rows — a few tens of megabytes next to hours of compute.

Determinism is what makes resumption *exact* rather than approximate, so it is worth stating what
was checked rather than assumed:

* All randomness in a run is drawn **before** the loop. ``MiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__`` seeds twice
  — ``KEYFRAME_ENCODE_SEED`` for the keyframe posterior sample and the request ``seed`` for the
  conditioning noise, the video latents and the audio latents — and never touches
  ``mx.random`` again. ``dit.py`` has no dropout and no sampling; the only ``mx.random`` calls in
  the transformer and the VAEs are weight initializers that run at construction and are then
  overwritten by the checkpoint.
* ``MiniMaxH3Scheduler.step`` is rectified-flow Euler with ``eta = 0``: pure float32 arithmetic on
  ``(model_output, timestep, sample)`` plus one integer of state, ``_step_index``. No noise term.

So the state above really is the whole state, and `test_checkpoint.py` proves it bit-for-bit
against an interrupted run. The RNG key is still snapshotted into every checkpoint and restored at
the resume seam — belt and braces, and it turns "the loop draws no randomness" from an assumption
into something the code re-checks on every resume (see `ResumableRun.rng_note`).

Nothing here reimplements ``__call__``. Three seams carry the whole feature:

* the **DiT proxy** sees the full packed rows at the top of every step, and returns a zero velocity
  for steps that are being fast-forwarded — which keeps the transformer's weights off the machine
  until the first step that actually needs them;
* the **scheduler**, whose class is rebound to :class:`ResumableScheduler`, returns its input
  unchanged for fast-forwarded steps and the checkpointed rows at the seam. It has to be the
  scheduler and not just a zero velocity from the DiT: a zero velocity makes the Euler update
  ``r*x + (1-r)*x``, and ``r + (1 - r)`` is not exactly ``1`` in float32, so the state would drift
  by an ulp per skipped step;
* the **text-encoder proxy**, which stores the prompt conditioning in the checkpoint so a resume
  never loads the 28.2 GB encoder again.
