"""Load mere.run's 8-bit Qwen3-VL conditioner.

The port's `MiniMaxH3TextEncoder` builds plain `nn.Linear` layers and then loads keys by name. On
an affine-quantized checkpoint that fails **silently and completely**:

* ``...q_proj.weight`` is packed uint32 of shape ``[8192, 1280]``; it matches the expected key
  ``...q_proj.weight`` and is written straight into a bf16 ``[8192, 5120]`` slot;
* ``...q_proj.scales`` / ``.biases`` are not in the expected set, so the loader counts them as
  "skipped" and drops them;
* the stock loader only raises on *missing* keys, and none are missing.

Worse, the stock loader casts every tensor with ``tensor.astype(dtype)``, which on packed uint32 is
an arithmetic conversion — the bit pattern is destroyed before it is even mis-stored.

This module fixes all of it by overriding `_load_weights`: quantize the module tree first, using
the recipe the converter recorded, then load with a **two-way** key check so a dropped ``scales``
is an error rather than a statistic.

The recipe cannot be a blanket `nn.quantize`: mere.run left `visual.blocks.N.mlp.linear_fc2` dense
(bf16 ``[1152, 4304]``, no scales), so quantizing it would invent a layer the checkpoint has no
weights for. `text_encoder/quant_config.json` lists the quantized module paths explicitly.
