"""Detect VAE-decode corruption in a frame: zero-filled tiles and tile-seam blocking artifacts.

Боевые ворота 2026-08-19's root cause (chunk-recon investigation, `~/Research/TestVideo/chunk-
recon/`): `VideoVAE.decode` (`upstream/minimax_h3_mlx/video_vae.py`) chains 13 chunks x 15 tiles —
up to 195 ViT-decoder forwards — into a single lazy MLX graph and materializes it once, at the very
end, with one `np.array()` call. Under allocator/memory pressure, a fraction of that graph's
intermediate buffers could come back as an unwritten (zero) or garbled buffer instead of the tile
actually computed — non-deterministically, invisible to any shape/dtype check, because the corrupt
buffer is still a well-formed array. Two visible symptoms: a tile (or a whole frame) decodes to a
flat fill color, or a tile lands correctly but disagrees with its neighbour hard enough at the seam
to be visible as blocking.

`patches/0003-vae-decode-eval.patch` (`h3_48gb.pipeline.vae_decode_eval_patch_applied`) bounds the
graph at the source, which should make both symptoms unreachable. This module is defense in depth
on top of that, not a redundant check to delete once the patch lands — a decode is expensive
(minutes) and feeds a scene chain (`h3_48gb.assemble`) a silently-corrupt keyframe would poison, so
every frame that reaches a caller is verified rather than trusted.

Both thresholds and the seam-score formula come from the investigation's own scripts, merged: the
tile-seam geometry originally came from `check_mp4.py`'s hardcoded five-column list (calibrated by
eye against one canvas, 896x512); the fixed `2.5` threshold and the zero-fill fraction floor are
`decode_after_unload.py`'s (the investigation's final, most-refined pass, run against the real
allocator state a production decode sees) — see each constant's own docstring for its exact
provenance.

**2026-08-24 fix (`.superpowers/fixes-2026-08-24/task-1-report.md`):** the hardcoded five-column /
two-row list was `check_mp4.py`'s calibration for 896x512 alone. On any other canvas, part of it
fell outside the frame and the surviving coordinates stopped being tile seams while still being
scored as if they were one — this is what stalled боевые ворота 2026-08-20 (two scene chains, ~3h
GPU, on clean 448x288 clips). `tile_seam_score` now computes seam positions from the frame's own
size, using the same tiling arithmetic `video_vae.py::_split_tiles` uses (`_vae_tile_starts`
below, ported to plain Python -- this module must stay `mlx`-free, see `video_vae.py:26-27`), and
returns the clean value `1.0` outright on any canvas too small to give the ratio enough points to
average over (`MIN_SEAM_POINTS`) rather than measuring noise. Measured: 448x288 never has enough
points and is why `zero_fill_fraction` is now that canvas's *only* corruption signal; 896x512 and
1344x768 both clear the floor and keep catching real corruption with wide margin. Full numbers in
the report above.

#: native decode, but the brief's own criterion is that a single false frame stalls a whole scene
#: chain, so an unverified 8-10-point band is not a safe place to leave the check on. The floor is
#: therefore set at 11 — the smallest point count actually measured clean, not the smallest
#: theoretically distinguishable one. Below it, only `zero_fill_fraction` (canvas-size-independent,
#: catches the same corruption `patches/0003` targets) still watches for corruption.
MIN_SEAM_POINTS = 11

#: Above this, `tile_seam_score`'s ratio of seam-adjacent pixel deltas to a same-tile baseline a
#: few pixels over reads as a real discontinuity rather than picture detail. Chosen empirically by
#: the investigation (`decode_after_unload.py`): clean frames scored <= 1.86, corrupted
#: (tile-boundary garbage) frames scored >= 2.80 across its sample; `2.5` sits in the gap with
#: margin on both sides. That sample was narrower than the docstring here used to claim — the
#: full `corruption-map.csv` (1600 frames) has a real grey zone between 2.80 and 5.59 among frames
#: `decode_after_unload.py` itself didn't call zero-filled — but the reference corrupt frames and
#: every clean frame measured for this fix (see `MIN_SEAM_POINTS`) both sit with wide margin on
#: their respective sides of `2.5`, so it stays unchanged rather than being retuned without cause.
