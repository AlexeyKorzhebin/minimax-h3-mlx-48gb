"""Prove that an interrupted run resumes to a bit-identical result, and refuses when it must not.

    ./.venv/bin/python tests/test_checkpoint.py        # same tests, no pytest needed

The claim under test is exactness, not similarity: a run stopped after step k and resumed must
produce the *same bytes* as a run that was never stopped. "Looks the same" would hide an ulp of
drift per step, which is precisely the failure mode a resume can introduce — see
`ResumableScheduler` on why a zero velocity through the real Euler step is not the identity.

Nothing here loads the real model. A 33B transformer at 586 s per step cannot be part of a test
suite, so `_ToyDiT` stands in: a cheap, deterministic, *state-dependent* function of the packed
rows and the timestep. Everything else on the resume path is the real thing — upstream's
``MiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__``, upstream's ``MiniMaxH3Scheduler``, upstream's packing, and the
fork's checkpoint writer, reader, proxies and identity check. The point of the stub is that the
transformer is the one component whose *value* the resume logic never inspects; substituting it
changes the numbers, not the control flow.

`test_tampered_checkpoint_changes_the_result` is the control: it perturbs one element of the saved
latents and shows the comparison notices. Without it, a test that compared two runs of an
insensitive stub would pass for the wrong reason.
