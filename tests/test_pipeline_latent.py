"""Prove that `MiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__` accepts raw latent rows as conditioning, and that
adding that parameter did not move a single existing run's identity digest.

    ./.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_pipeline_latent.py -q

`docs/FEASIBILITY-latent-handoff.md` §1.2: the tail of a previous scene is already in exactly the
space `_encode_keyframes` produces — patchified, normalized `(latent - mean) / std`, float32 — so
handing it back needs no VAE encode at all, only a way in. `condition_latent_rows` is that way in.
It bypasses `_encode_keyframes` entirely (and with it the float16 round trip, which reproduces a
rounding *inside* the reference's VAE encode and has nothing to say about rows that were never
encoded), but it does **not** bypass the noise augmentation: the rows land in the same slot the
packed layout marks as `t = 0.999`, so they are noised with `scale_noise(..., KEYFRAME_NOISE_AUG)`
exactly like an image keyframe's rows. That is what `test_latent_rows_reach_the_transformer_*`
pins, on values.

Four refusals, all loud, all here: an empty block, a shape that does not match the request's
geometry, a dtype that is not float32, and `images` passed alongside. The shape one is the
load-bearing check — `video_rows = mx.concatenate([condition_rows, video_rows])` (upstream :289)
would happily accept a block of the wrong length and desynchronize it from
`layout.num_condition_video_rows`, so every row of the sequence would be denoised against the
wrong position, timestep and mask, silently. The empty one guards a shape the check above cannot
see through: `(0, PATCH_DIM)` matches `expected` whenever `keyframe_anchors` is also empty, yet
still draws a real `mx.random.normal` sample and shifts every later noise draw off a bare run's.

The identity tests are the other half of the task, and they are about a *hazard*, not a feature:
`request_identity` (`h3_48gb/checkpoint.py:150`) hashes `bound.arguments` wholesale, so a new
parameter — even one left at its `None` default — would change the digest of **every run this
fork has ever checkpointed** and orphan every checkpoint on disk. `_IDENTITY_EXCLUDED` keeps that
from happening; `BASELINE_IDENTITY_DIGEST` below was captured from a real run *before* the
parameter existed, and `test_identity_digest_of_a_latent_free_run_is_unchanged` compares against
it byte for byte. The price is `test_identity_is_blind_to_the_latent_tail`, which pins the
resulting hole rather than hiding it — see that test's docstring and BACKLOG.md.

Nothing here loads the real model: `ToyPipeline` (tests/test_checkpoint.py) drives upstream's real
`__call__`, real packing and real scheduler with stand-ins for the four heavy components.
