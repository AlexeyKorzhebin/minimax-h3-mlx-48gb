"""The DiT loader's contract about the AdaLN modulation path.

The loader deletes that path from the module tree before anything can evaluate it — 13B parameters
this build never allocates — and serves the modulation from `adaln_cache.safetensors` instead. Two
kinds of checkpoint then exist in the wild:

* mere.run's, which omits those tensors, which is where the design came from;
* pipenetwork's, which ships them, and would otherwise be rejected as 206 unexpected keys.

Both must load, and a genuinely stray tensor must still fail. These tests build a doll-sized DiT
rather than the real 20B one; the loader does not care how large the tree is, only which keys it
holds.
