"""Cut a scene's latent tail off at the one seam where it is still raw, and hand it back later.

    ./.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_latent_tail.py -q

`docs/FEASIBILITY-latent-handoff.md` §1.2-§1.3. Task 1 taught `packing.py` to anchor a
conditioning block at an arbitrary pixel-frame index; task 2 taught upstream's `__call__` to
accept those blocks as raw rows (`condition_latent_rows`). This file is the two ends that make
those usable from the command line: `--save-latent-tail N` on the scene that produces the tail,
`--latent <path>` on the scene that continues from it.

**Where the write happens, and why exactly there.** `LazyMiniMaxH3Pipeline._decode_video` opens
with `mx.eval(rows)` and then drops the transformer. Those rows are the finished video latent,
still patchified and still normalized -- the same space `_encode_keyframes` produces, so the tail
needs no conversion at either end (spec §1.2, "Ни одного преобразования между сохранением и
приёмом нет"). One line later `unpatchify_video_tokens` and the mean/std denormalize have moved it
out of that space, and the VAE has begun turning it into pixels. So the seam is *between*
`mx.eval(rows)` and the unpatchify, and `test_the_tail_is_written_after_the_rows_are_materialized`
is what holds it there -- not by checking that some `mx.eval` happened earlier (the previous
step's own eval satisfies that, one iteration late; `h3_48gb/checkpoint.py`'s `written_at` bug was
exactly that off-by-one) but by identifying the *frame* that called `mx.eval` and the *object* it
was handed.

**Why the kwargs are fork-only.** `save_latent_tail` / `latent_tail_stem` are popped in
`LazyMiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__` before upstream's signature is bound, exactly as
`h3_48gb.preview.PREVIEW_KWARGS` are. `request_identity` hashes `bound.arguments` wholesale, so
anything surviving that bind joins the checkpoint identity -- and *where a scene writes its tail*
must not decide which checkpoint it resumes from.
`test_saving_a_latent_tail_does_not_move_the_run_identity` compares the two digests directly.

Nothing here loads the real model: `Bare`/`StubVAE` (tests/test_decode_video_uint8.py) drive the
real `_decode_video` with a stand-in for the 5.21 GB video VAE.
