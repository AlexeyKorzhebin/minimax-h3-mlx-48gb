"""The baked table must reproduce the shipped one — all of it, not just the blocks.

`scripts/bake_adaln.py` reconstructs the AdaLN modulation table from the pruned base's folded
time curve, which is what lets this fork run any step count instead of only 31. It was verified
against the shipped table block by block, and `final_modulations` was not checked at all — so a
bug that evaluated the output layer on the wrong clock and sliced its 10752 outputs into three
chunks of 3584 went unnoticed through a full day of experiments. Nothing raised: the output layer
indexes that table by timestep alone, so a wrong-width row reads as a valid one.
