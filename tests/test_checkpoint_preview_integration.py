"""Prove `h3_48gb.checkpoint` and `h3_48gb.preview` work *together*, not just separately.

    ./.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_checkpoint_preview_integration.py -q

Both features were built concurrently against the same seam -- `pipeline.dit` -- and are on by
default in `run_bench.py` (`--preview-every` defaults to 5, checkpointing is opt-out via
`--no-checkpoint`), so their combination is the default path a real run takes, not an edge case.
`tests/test_checkpoint.py` proves checkpointing alone is exact; `test_preview.py` proves preview
alone is safe. Neither exercises the other, which is exactly the gap the checkpoint author's own
note flags:

    its `PreviewInterceptor` also wraps `self.dit` (`preview.py:276`). Both are
    attribute-forwarding proxies so nesting works, but whoever installs second must wrap rather
    than replace.

`h3_48gb.pipeline.LazyMiniMaxH3Pipeline.__call__` installs `PreviewInterceptor` first (wrapping
the raw `dit`), then delegates to `CheckpointingPipeline.__call__` (via the MRO), which installs
`StepInterceptor` second (wrapping whatever `self.dit` currently is -- the preview interceptor).
So at the moment the denoising loop actually calls `self.dit(...)`, the chain is
`StepInterceptor(PreviewInterceptor(real_dit))`: checkpoint outermost, preview innermost. That is
what makes a fast-forwarded step invisible to preview (`StepInterceptor` returns before ever
calling into its `_inner`) without preview needing to know checkpointing exists at all. Verifying
that this is exactly what happens -- and that it is not an accident of the order two lines happen
to be written in -- is what this file is for.

Reuses `tests/test_checkpoint.py`'s stub infrastructure (`ToyPipeline`, `_ToyDiT`, `run`,
`identical`) rather than inventing a second set, and `test_preview.py`'s tiny real `VideoVAE` so a
preview genuinely decodes instead of only ever exercising the VAE-less fallback. Nothing here loads
the real 33B transformer or a real-sized VAE -- one native step costs 586s, which has no place in a
test suite.
