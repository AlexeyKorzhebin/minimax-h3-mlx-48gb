"""Prove the vision patch-embed conv weight lands in the right layout, not just a matching shape.

Run directly (no pytest needed)::

    ./.venv/bin/python test_vision_patch_embed_layout.py

The bug being fixed: the converted checkpoint stores ``model.visual.patch_embed.proj.weight`` in
PyTorch's conv layout, ``(out, in, D, H, W)``. ``mlx.nn.Conv3d`` expects channels-last,
``(out, D, H, W, in)``. The real checkpoint's kernel is ``(D, H, W) = (2, 16, 16)`` — H and W equal
— which means a shape check alone cannot tell the correct permutation, ``(0, 2, 3, 4, 1)``, apart
from a wrong one that also swaps H and W, e.g. ``(0, 4, 3, 2, 1)``: both produce a
``(out, 2, 16, 16, in)`` tensor. A wrong permutation would not raise anywhere — it would silently
scramble the patch embedding, and the only symptom would be a worse clip, hours later.

So every test below either uses dimensions that are all pairwise distinct (so a wrong permutation
changes the *shape*, not just the values) or checks values against a reference computed with plain
Python indexing rather than another call to ``.transpose()`` (so a bug shared between the function
under test and the check itself cannot cancel out).
